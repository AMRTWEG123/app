WAM is a custom measurement developed by Wikia to capture a number of independent indicators into one overall index, like the Billboard or Parker score. It’s based on weighted algorithm of unique users, page views, momentum, multi-media and more.

The WAM is calculated daily for the top 5,000 Wikis and includes an overall and vertical rank as well as a score from 0 to 100. The WAM rankings are sensitive to real-world events and change frequently, so be sure to check back regularly to see the latest trends. The WAM can also be viewed daily on each of our [[Video Games|Video Game]], [[Entertainment]] and [[Lifestyle]] hub pages.',
